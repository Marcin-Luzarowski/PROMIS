# PROMIS
The package was prepared to use size exclusion chromatography-derived data to predict molecular complexes based on similarity of their elution profiles. Package allows to test chosen criteria, prepare ROC curve, plot elution profiles and generate heatmaps.

File "Way_to_use_example.R" informs how the function could be combined in order to analyse PROMIS data.

Remember:
Before start - load required libraries, load functions, which are present in:
#1) load_data.R
#2) plot_data.R
#3) data_processing.R
and check training data available in "Data_example" folder.
